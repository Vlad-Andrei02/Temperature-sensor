Developed an Arduino-based project using an LM35 temperature sensor to monitor environmental temperature. The system reads the analog output from the sensor, converts it to Celsius, and activates an LED if the temperature exceeds a specified threshold. The project features a simple wiring setup and includes serial communication to display real-time temperature readings.
